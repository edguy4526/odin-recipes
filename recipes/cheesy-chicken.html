        <p>This recipe is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are coated in a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried to a golden brown, and finished in a lovely cream sauce. A side of pasta would be good with this, or try mashed potatoes. A green vegetable and a salad will complete this dinner menu, nicely!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs chicken breat tenders</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>Parchment paper</li>
            <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Place flour on a shallow plate and beaten eggs in a shallow bowl. Place grated Parmesan, panko crumbs, and paprika on another shallow plate. Cover a dinner plate with parchment paper.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Dip each chicken tender in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beaten egg, allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Place tender on the panko mixture and scoop panko mix over the tenders. Place on the plate, and repeat until all tenders are done.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Melt 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time, being careful not to crowd the skillet. Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no longer pink in the center, or 3-4 minutes per side.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Turn tenders when crust is browned and continue cooking until a thermometer in the center reads 74 degrees Celsius. Add a bit more oil or butter if the skillet is dry, or adjust heat if the crust is too brown. Place chicken on a cooling rack.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Add garlic to the skillet and stir until fragrant. Deglaze skillet with wine and season with Italian herb blend and red pepper flakes.</p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Stir in cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil, stir frequently, and adjust flavor if needed. Allow sauce to bubble for 3-4 minutes. Return tenders to the skillet for about a minute, and garnish with fresh parsley.</p>
