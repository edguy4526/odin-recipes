                <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>

                <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 (15 oz) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>

                <li>1 cup whole corn kernels, cooked</li>
                <li>1 cup white hominy</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips</li>
                <li>2 medium avocados, sliced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                <li>2 tbsp chopped green onions</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
